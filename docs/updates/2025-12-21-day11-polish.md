# day 11: polish & error handling

typed errors, structured logging, graceful shutdown.

---

## what shipped

**typed errors (go + js)**
- `ConnectionError` - can't reach the browser
- `TimeoutError` - element didn't appear in time
- `ElementNotFoundError` - selector matched nothing
- `BrowserCrashedError` - chrome died unexpectedly

errors now have context. you know *what* failed and *why*.

**structured logging**
- go: slog-based JSON logging
- js: `VIBIUM_DEBUG=1` environment flag
- quiet by default, verbose with `--verbose` or `-v`

no log spam unless you ask for it.

**graceful shutdown**
- panic recovery with `process.WithCleanup()`
- all browser commands wrapped
- chrome processes cleaned up even on crashes

no more zombie browsers.

---

## the philosophy

tools should be quiet when things work, helpful when they don't.

- success: clean output, no noise
- failure: typed error with context
- debugging: opt-in verbose logs

## next up
